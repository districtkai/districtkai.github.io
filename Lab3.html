<h1>Pinniped</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
<p1><span>Pinnipeds (pronounced /ˈpɪnɪˌpɛdz/), commonly known as seals,[a] are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic, mostly marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the walrus), Otariidae (the eared seals: sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 34 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora; their closest living relatives are musteloids (weasels, raccoons, skunks, and red pandas), having diverged about 50 million years ago.</span></p1>

<h1>Etymology</h1>
<p1><span2>The name "pinniped" derives from the Latin words pinna "fin" and pes, pedis "foot".[2] The common name "seal" originates from the Old English word seolh, which is in turn derived from the Proto-Germanic *selkhaz.[3]</span2></p1>

<h1>Evolutionary history</h1>
<p1><span3>>One popular hypothesis suggested that pinnipeds are diphyletic (descended from two ancestral lines), with walruses and otariids sharing a recent common ancestor with bears and phocids sharing one with Musteloidea. However, morphological and molecular evidence support a monophyletic origin.[14] A 2021 genetic study found that pinnipeds are more closely related to musteloids.[19] Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 million years ago (mya) during the Eocene.[20] Their evolutionary link to terrestrial mammals was unknown until the 2007 discovery of Puijila in early Miocene deposits in Nunavut, Canada. Like a modern otter, Puijila had a long tail, short limbs and webbed feet instead of flippers. However, its limbs and shoulders were more robust and Puijila likely had been a quadrupedal swimmer—retaining a form of aquatic locomotion that gave rise to the major swimming types employed by modern pinnipeds. The researchers who found Puijila placed it in a clade with Potamotherium (traditionally considered a mustelid) and Enaliarctos. Of the three, Puijila was the least specialized for aquatic life. The discovery of Puijila in a lake deposit suggests that pinniped evolution went through a freshwater transitional phase.[21]</span3></p1>

<h1>Anatomy and physiology</h1>
<p1><span4>Pinnipeds have streamlined, spindle-shaped bodies with reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails.[26][27] Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region.[28] They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are mostly shaped by the maxilla which are not contained by certain facial bones.[14] Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials.[29] The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks.[30] The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.[26]</span4></p1>
